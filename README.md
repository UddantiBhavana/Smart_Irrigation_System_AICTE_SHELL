# 💧 Smart_Irrigation_System_AICTE_SHELL

**AICTE Internship – Cycle 2 | July 2025**

---

## 📘 Project Description

This internship project focuses on three distinct but interrelated machine learning applications.  
The first application — **Smart Irrigation System** — aims to build a predictive model for efficient irrigation management.

By leveraging environmental data (such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity), the system helps optimize water usage in agricultural fields, promoting sustainability and reducing wastage.
