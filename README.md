# Smart_Irrigation_System_AICTE_SHELL

## AICTE Internship Cycle 2 - July 2025

### **Project Description**
This internship project focuses on three distinct but interrelated machine learning applications.

**Smart Irrigation System:**  
We aim to build a predictive model for efficient irrigation management.  
By leveraging environmental data (such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity), the model optimizes water usage in agricultural fields, ensuring sustainability while reducing wastage.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Language:** Python (3.12.8)
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, GitHub

## **Key Features**
- Data preprocessing and analysis.
- Predictive modeling using Random Forest Classifier.
- Visualization of irrigation data with matplotlib and seaborn.
- Model saving and loading using joblib.
